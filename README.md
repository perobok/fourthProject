I used node express for local server on port 8081. I configured webpack module bundler. Both modes, production and development, are available and buildable as well. 
I used scss for my styling and css minimiser to. 
At the end I produced jest testing to test functionality. 
Service workers are present as well. 

I had some problems with runing production mode while some of vesions wasn't wright inside package.json file. After couple days I figure out how to solve these issues.
